# cypher-grahpics

messin around with cryptography and graphics. starting off with....

# kid-rsa

developed by Neal Koblitz as an educational stepping-stone into public-key cryptography.

_Note: KidRSA is not secure (and my implementation in js probably double so). Don't use this for anything other than playing around._

## run:

just run `$ node kid-rsa.js`. native JS, no dependencies.

It'll pick random seed-values (a, b, aa, bb) and a random messsage (for now, just an integer) to encrypt and decrypt using the generated public/private keys.

See an example of output in `kid-rsa-example-out.md`

peace out
